To make it easier for developers to build data services, we developed the SQRL language which gives SQL a facelift and adds some important features to make it developer friendly, productive, and fun. Here is why we need a modern, developer-focused version of SQL.

SQL is the most popular query language and great for manipulating structured data. But SQL is not a great development language, and it's a bit ... well, old. It's a fantastic accomplishment for a 50+ year old language to be in wide-spread use today, but to keep up with the times a lot of features were bolted onto SQL that make it feel a bit frankensteinish today. Yes, we are looking at you SQL:2016.

Plus, most developers have a love-hate relationship with SQL because they primarily use it through ORMs or other abstraction layers. That level of indirection can make things unintuitive and embedding SQL as a string is just ugly. That's why ORMs have been called "the Vietnam of software engineering", and while an analogy with a major war seems a wee bit dramatic, it does capture developer feelings pretty accurately.

We believe that SQL is the best starting point if you are trying to build with data, but there are a few things missing to make it a productive choice for implementing data services.

## Data Streams


## Relationships


## Nested Data


## Modularity



SQRL addresses these shortcomings in SQL while being fully compatible with SQL. Learn more about SQRL or follow a short tutorial to see how you can build a data service in minutes with SQRL.
