# DataSQRL 0.1: A SQRL is born

<img src="/img/blog/datasqrlv0.1.jpeg" alt="DataSQRL v0.1 release: A SQRL is Born >" width="40%"/>

After two long years of research, development, and teamwork, we're excited to announce DataSQRL 0.1! [DataSQRL](/) is a tool for building APIs from your data streams and datasets by defining your use case in a [SQL dialect](/docs/getting-started/concepts/sqrl).

This is our first “official” release of DataSQRL after many months of testing and bug-fixing. <br />
Check out the [release notes](https://github.com/DataSQRL/sqrl/releases/tag/v0.1.0) on GitHub for a rundown of all the features.

## Our Vision

Every time we wanted to build a new use case for our application and expose a data API, we found ourselves getting distracted. Distracted by all the orchestration, the technology choices, all the micro-decisions, and the 'plumbing' that goes into the modern data layer. So we up-leveled the abstraction and kept it simple. We [designed DataSQRL](/docs/getting-started/concepts/why-datasqrl) to handle those nitty-gritty details, so you could stay focused on what truly mattered - building cool things.

## Simplicity Through SQL

We've kept [DataSQRL true to SQL](/docs/getting-started/concepts/sqrl), so it feels familiar and easy to use. We enhanced and modernized the language while maintaining the simplicity of SQL queries. No more wrestling with subqueries, window functions, or repetitive joins - just straightforward SQL.

## Flexible APIs

One size doesn't fit all when it comes to APIs. We made DataSQRL non-opinionated, giving you the freedom to use your [preferred GraphQL schema](/docs/reference/api/graphql/design) and customize your query patterns with SQRL scripts.

## Our Road Ahead

We're seeking [your feedback](/community) to help shape the future of DataSQRL. Our current architecture supports a range of platforms, and we're working on making it more extensible and useful. Your input is invaluable as we continue to refine and expand DataSQRL's capabilities.

## Conclusion

The only danger now is that your boss might think he can start coding again. [Join us](/community) as we explore the story behind DataSQRL, its impact on the world of data processing, and the exciting possibilities it holds for the future.
