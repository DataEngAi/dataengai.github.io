Unfortunately, my semi-retirement has come to an end.

It’s been an incredible ten months waking up and not having to be anywhere other than school dropoff.  However, all good things must turn into even better things!

I’m happy to announce that I’ve joined my old friends from DataStax, [Matthias Broecheler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthiasbroecheler/), and [Daniel Henneberger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-henneberger-8721a5155/), as co-founder of [DataSQRL](https://www.datasqrl.com).

And what a time to join! Our self-funded venture is already profitable, with a growing customer base.

## What does [DataSQRL](https://www.datasqrl.com) do?

Your “***Operating System for Data***” builds data products in ***minutes***.  Gone are months wasted attempting to integrate multiple vendor technologies for a data pipeline.

DataSQRL abstracts and automates the building of data pipelines through our SQL interface, which we’ve affectionately dubbed SQRL.  Yes, pronounced “Squirrel,” just like the fuzzy little guys running around your yard.

Have you struggled with Apache Kafka?  Flink?  Streaming?  Data in motion? Integrating your Artificial Intelligence into your systems?  Anything “Real-Time?” Struggle no more, and [get started here!](https://www.datasqrl.com/docs/getting-started/getting-started/)

We provide an open-source tool that can help you along with some professional services.

Now that *that* is out of the way, onto more interesting things…

## What did I do over these last ten months? You’re wondering…

What *didn’t* I do?  I…

- Spent a ton of time watching my autistic son make incredible progress
- Helped produce a shark documentary, [Unmasking Monsters Below](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15475848/?ref_=tt_mv_close), with my friend, Kevin Lapsley

I promise that some of my upcoming posts will cover what I did over the last ten months.  You know me… However, here are some highlights in pictures…

***A 3x Silicon Valley Unicorn veteran with IPO experience, award-winning screenwriter, and 2006 Time Magazine “Person of the Year,” Canz is often mistaken for Joe Rogan while walking down the street.  He can be found on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/canz/), [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3376659/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1), and helping people how to pronounce “Conshohocken.”***
