# How to Connect Data Sources to DataSQRL

DataSQRL supports the following types of data sources to consume data from:

* **[Filesystem](files)**: Connect data stored in files on a local or mounted filesystem to DataSQRL.
* **[Kafka](kafka)**: Connect Kafka to DataSQLR to consume data from the log.

:::note

Is your data source missing from the list? You can add a data source connector
to DataSQRL to support your data source. That's the power of open source!
