Principles 1-3 from the data mesh. In combination with "custmoer focused" gives you the data mesh principles.

--------

Data Mesh is a decentralized approach to data platform architecture and organizational structure. It was introduced by Zhamak Dehghani to address the challenges of scaling data platforms in large organizations. The core principles of Data Mesh are:

1. Domain-oriented ownership: Data Mesh encourages treating data as a product, with cross-functional teams responsible for their own domain's data products. These teams ensure the data's quality, discoverability, and accessibility.

2. Self-serve data infrastructure: Data Mesh promotes providing self-serve data infrastructure as a platform, enabling domain teams to easily access, discover, and use data without relying on centralized data teams. This approach reduces bottlenecks and fosters autonomy.

3. Product thinking for data: Data Mesh shifts the focus from data as a byproduct of applications to data as a product itself. This means considering aspects like usability, quality, and reliability while designing and managing data assets.

4. Federated computational governance: Data Mesh proposes a decentralized approach to governance, with shared policies, standards, and best practices across the organization. This enables local decision-making while maintaining consistency and compliance with organizational requirements.

By adopting these core principles, Data Mesh aims to create a scalable, resilient, and efficient data platform that empowers teams to use data effectively and drive innovation in large organizations.
