# Getting Started with DataSQRL

Fantastic, you want to get started with DataSQRL and build data services the fast and easy way. You'll be building data services successfully with DataSQLR in no time. How you get started is up to you. We recommend the "Learning by Doing" route but you can choose your own adventure.

## Learning By Doing

If you're looking to learn DataSQRL, the best way is to build something with it. It doesn't have to be perfect, and you don't need to build something that is the biggest and baddest thing ever. Just get started, and make something you are proud of.

**STEP 1:** Follow the [Introductory Tutorial](quickstart) to build a data service for a nut shop in 10 minutes. The tutorial gives you a high-level overview of DataSQRL and guides you through the steps to build a data service from zero to querying the data service API.

**STEP 2:** Dive into the [DataSQRL Training](./intro/overview) to get a deeper understanding of DataSQRL and all the knowledge you need to build your own custom data service in DataSQRL. The training extends the tutorial and explains all the concepts in more detail.

**STEP 3:** Build your own data service in DataSQRL. Take a problem from work or grab some data you've been interested in and give it a go. <br />
If you run into a problem or need to use a DataSQRL feature we haven't covered yet, take a look at the [DataSQRL guides](/docs/guides/overview) for howto instructions or the [reference documentation](/docs/reference/overview) for everything you'd ever wanted to know about DataSQRL and then some. <br />

DataSQRL makes it easier and faster to build [data services](/docs/reference/concepts/data-service) from streaming data sources. [Read more about](concepts/why-datasqrl.md) why building data services is so difficult and how DataSQRL tries to make it less painful.

DataSQRL is essentially a compiler and optimizer for an SQL-based language called [SQRL](/docs/getting-started/concepts/sqrl) that extends SQL with syntax and constructs to make it developer friendly. You implement the logic and structure of your data service in SQRL and DataSQRL compiles it into ingest layers, data transformations, analytics, schemas, databases, and APIs for you. The result is an end-to-end integrated data pipeline with an API serving layer. [Learn more about](/docs/getting-started/concepts/datasqrl) DataSQRL and all the plumbing and integration work it takes off your shoulders.

Zooming out a bit, DataSQRL is an implementation of a view store that fills the gap between database systems and data warehouses for data-intensive workloads like data services. Find out how [DataSQRL compares](./comparison/overview) to other data technologies and why you should add DataSQRL to your data tool belt.

What to know more? Start with the [reference documentation](/docs/reference/overview) to learn everything there is to know about DataSQRL. <br />
What to go even deeper? The [developer documentation](/docs/dev/overview) details the internals of DataSQRL and takes you deep into the guts of the system.
