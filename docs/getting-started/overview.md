# Getting Started with DataSQRL

Fantastic, you want to get started with DataSQRL and build streaming data APIs the fast and easy way. You'll be building data APIs successfully with DataSQLR in no time. How you get started is up to you. We recommend the "Learning by Doing" route, but you can choose your own adventure.

## Learning By Doing

If you're looking to learn DataSQRL, the best way is to build something with it. Read the introductory tutorial to get situated, and then build something you enjoy.

**STEP 1:** Follow the [Quickstart Tutorial](../quickstart) to build a customer 360 API for our seed shop in 5 minutes. The tutorial walks you through an example and builds a whole data pipeline.

**STEP 2:** Dive into the [DataSQRL introduction](../intro/overview) to get a deeper understanding of DataSQRL and all the knowledge you need to build your own custom data APIs in DataSQRL. The introduction extends the quickstart and explains all the concepts in more detail.

**STEP 3:** Build your own data API in DataSQRL. Take a problem from work or grab some data you've been interested in and give it a go. <br />
If you run into a problem or need to use a DataSQRL feature we haven't covered yet, take a look at the [reference documentation](/docs/reference/overview) for everything you'd ever wanted to know about DataSQRL and then some. <br />
Still stuck? No worries, the [DataSQRL community](/community) is here to help. Seriously, reach out - we don't bite!

## Understanding the Big Picture

There are a million technologies out there so why should you spend your time on DataSQRL? If you want to understand how DataSQRL fits into the bigger picture and whether it's worth your time, here are some resources to get you started.

DataSQRL makes it easier and faster to build [data services](/docs/reference/concepts/data-service) from streaming data sources, i.e. process data streams into data APIs. [Read more about](../concepts/why-datasqrl) why building data services is so difficult and how DataSQRL tries to make it less painful.

DataSQRL is a compiler, optimizer, and build tool for an SQL-based language called [SQRL](/docs/getting-started/concepts/sqrl) that extends SQL with features to "react" to streaming data. You implement the logic and structure of your data service in SQRL and DataSQRL compiles it into ingest layers, data transformations, analytics, schemas, databases, and APIs for you. The result is an end-to-end streaming data pipeline with an API serving layer. [Learn more about](/docs/getting-started/concepts/datasqrl) DataSQRL and all the plumbing and integration work it takes off your shoulders.

If you are deciding between different pieces of technology for your data API project, find out how [DataSQRL compares](../comparison/overview) to other data technologies and why you should add DataSQRL to your data tool belt.

What to know more? Start with the [reference documentation](/docs/reference/overview) to learn everything there is to know about DataSQRL. <br />
What to go even deeper? The [developer documentation](/docs/dev/overview) details the internals of DataSQRL and takes you deep into the guts of the system.
