# DataSQRL Tutorials

The tutorials implement a use case with DataSQRL. We currently cover the following use cases:

* [**Customer 360 & Personalization**](../customer360/intro): Build a customer 360 by integrating customer data.
* [**Recommendations**](../recommendations/intro): Build a content recommendation engine based on click-stream data.
* [**Internet of Things**](../iot/intro): Aggregate and analyze sensor data from a factory floor.

We'll be adding more tutorials with time, so check back soon. If you'd like to see another use case covered, please
[let us know](/community).
