If you are new to DataSQRL or SQRL, we recommend that you start with the [Quickstart tutorial](../../getting-started/quickstart) or one of the other [DataSQRL tutorials](../../getting-started/tutorials/overview).

The reference documentation is divided into 4 sections:

* [**SQRL**](../sqrl/overview): Documentation of the SQRL language for writing SQRL scripts. SQRL is an SQL dialect with some syntactic sugar to make data product implementations easier.
* [**API**](../api/overview): Documentation of how to query and design the data APIs compiled by DataSQRL.
* [**Sources & Sinks**](../sources/overview): Documentation on how to create data sources and sinks for ingesting and exporting data from and to external sources.
* [**Build**](../operations/build): Documentation on how to compile, run, and deploy DataSQRL scripts.

In addition, there is documentation on the [key concepts](/docs/category/key-concepts) that are used throughout this documentation.
