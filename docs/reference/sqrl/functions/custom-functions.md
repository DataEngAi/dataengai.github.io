# Implement Custom Functions

A custom function package contains function definitions and implementations that the DataSQRL compiler can import into a script.

::: info
Before implementing a custom function package, check if the function you need is part of the [system function library](/docs/category/functions) or can be found in the [repository](https://dev.datasqrl.com).
:::

To create a new function package, first create a sub-folder `myFunctionPackage` in the directory of the script where you want to import the functions. 

Then follow the instructions below for implementing a function package in the language of your choice.

Note, that function packages can be [published to the repository](../../operations/repository#publish), so you can reuse your functions across scripts.
