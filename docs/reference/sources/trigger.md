# Trigger Sinks

A trigger sink is a sink that triggers an action for each record that is exported to the sink based on the data in the record. Actions that a sink can trigger include API calls, function invocations, and alerts.



Trigger sinks are configured and used like [data sinks](overview) but behave differently. They don't connect to another data system to write data to but invoke an action.
