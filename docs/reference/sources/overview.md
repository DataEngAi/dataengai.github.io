## How to Connect Data Sources

You can connect data sources to a DataSQRL server instance either through the 
[data sources API](api) exposed by the server or using the
[DataSQLR command line utility](../cmd#sources).

The command line utility is a wrapper around the [data sources API](api) which makes it 
convenient and easy to use.
However, the utility may not support a particular type of data source or all of the 
configuration options available in the API. For all the options, we recommend that you
check out the reference documentation for the [data sources API](api).

If you are trying to connect a particular type of data source to DataSQRL, take a look at
the [full list of supported data sources](/docs/guides/sources/overview)
which detailed guides on how to connect them.
