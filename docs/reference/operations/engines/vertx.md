# Vertx Server Engine

[Vert.x](https://vertx.io/) is a lightweight and flexible open-source framework for building reactive, event-driven applications in Java and other JVM languages. It provides a comprehensive toolkit for developing scalable and high-performance networked applications that can handle a large number of concurrent connections. The framework's key features include a non-blocking API that allows for efficient use of resources, a modular architecture that enables easy integration with other libraries, and a distributed event bus for communication between components.

Vert.x currently supports [GraphQL APIs](../../../api/graphql/query).

## Configure

DataSQRL uses the Vert.x server engine by default which requires no extra configuration.
