# Deep-Dive & Developer Documentation

DataSQRL is an open-source project, which means you can view the [entire source code](https://github.com/DataSQRL/sqrl), [fork](https://github.com/DataSQRL/sqrl/fork) and customize it, and make contributions to the project.

If you are interested to dive into the DataSQRL source code, here are some pointers to get you started:

* The [architecture](../architecture) documentation provides a high-level overview of the modules that comprise DataSQRL and their dependency tree. This is the best place to start to understand the structure of the project.
* Most of the developer documentation lives with the source code. Check out the README files for each of the modules and the JavaDoc for package and class level documentation.

To get a preview of upcoming features and see what we are currently working on, take a look at the [roadmap](../roadmap) which summarizes the big ticket items and epics that are scheduled for development. However, active discussion of the roadmap and feature requests happens in the [Slack community](/community). <br />
To report bugs and view a ticket-level breakdown of development, head to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/DataSQRL/sqrl/issues).
