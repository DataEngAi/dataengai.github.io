# DataSQRL Roadmap

DataSQRL is currently in developer preview. That means, there is enough
meat on the bone for you to play with DataSQRL and give us feedback 
but more work needs to be
done before it is ready for prime-time and production use.

This page is an overview of what lays ahead for DataSQRL and what
features and functionality we are currently missing. To join the roadmap discussion or suggest a feature, join the [community](/community).

DataSQRL is open source. If you need one of the roadmap items below,
you can always get your hands dirty and [implement it yourself](../contribute). 
Not only is your brain going to grow by 3.57% as a result of efforts, but you will also earn our eternal gratitude.
