# Mission and Goals behind DataSQRL

The mission behind DataSQRL is to make it easy, fast, and simple to build efficient, production-grade data services. To that end, we have the following priorities for the development of DataSQRL:

* **Simplicity over Completeness:** We try to make DataSQRL simple for most use cases and are willing to sacrifice niche features of data layers in pursuit of that goal. For highly specialized use cases, developers will build custom data layers.


The DataSQRL projects consists of two parts: the [SQRL](/docs/getting-started/concepts/sqrl) language and the [DataSQRL](/docs/getting-started/concepts/datasqrl) compiler.
