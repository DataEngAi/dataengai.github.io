# How to Contribute to DataSQLR

We appreciate your contribution to DataSQRL - together we can build something great.

Whether you submit a [bug report](https://github.com/DataSQRL/sqrl/issues), help [answer questions](/community) from the community, [share your opinion](/community), write a tutorial, or make code contributions, you are doing a great service to the [DataSQRL community](/community).

If you want to make a code contribution, we'd like to suggest the following:
* reach out on the [development channel](/community) to make sure nobody is working on the same thing. We'd hate for your development effort to be wasted.
* we appreciate code contributions as pull requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/DataSQRL/sqrl). Please add sufficient test coverage and a description of your contribution.
* if you have any questions at all, please let us know on the [development channel on Slack](/community).

A good place to get started is by implementing support for additional data sources, sinks, or data formats for DataSQRL.
