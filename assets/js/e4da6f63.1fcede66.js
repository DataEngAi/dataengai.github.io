It is a modern alternative to SQL that extends its capabilities, providing developers with a more concise, intuitive, and productive way to work with data."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"SQRL scripts are written in a SQL-like syntax that is easy to understand, even for developers who are not familiar with SQL. The language is loosely-typed, meaning that the data types of columns and tables are inferred from the input data. This saves time and reduces the need for manual type and schema management. In addition, SQRL supports IMPORT statements to declare data dependencies, allowing developers to easily manage their data sources."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"One of the key advantages of SQRL is its incremental table definition feature.

It extends the capabilities of SQL and makes data service development more intuitive, efficient, and productive. SQRL is ideal for developers who are looking to build streaming data services, but it also offers features that make it a valuable tool for any data service project. Whether you are a seasoned SQL developer or new to data management, SQRL is an excellent choice for building data services that meet your needs and provide value to your customers."))}p.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
